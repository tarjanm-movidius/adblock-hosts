Say you have some little Linux board in your network
Say you run dnsmasq on it
Say you tell your router to use its (fixed) IP as DNS server on DHCP
This is your hosts file.

Say you enable logging too, dns_procservers.sh will process it (gzipped) for
further trash servers to add to the list

Not exactly the first attempt to accomplish this, submodules rolling in.
